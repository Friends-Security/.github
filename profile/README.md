## `whoami`

*Friends & Security* is a security research blog created by four friendsâ€”**Yehuda Smirnov**, **Hai Vaknin**, **Hoshea Yarden**, and **Noam Pomerantz**.

After working together in the field, we decided to launch this blog as a way to share our research, findings, and insights with the broader security community.

You can find the blog at https://blog.fndsec.net
